# VeltEngine

VeltEngine is a small open-source project building a game engine from scratch. The main engine is called Velt, written in C++ and built on top of the Vulkan graphics API.

The goal is a usable 2D and 3D engine with a built-in editor, C# scripting, physics via Box2D, and a basic audio system. It is still early in development, but the core rendering foundation is being actively worked on.

If you are curious about the project or want to follow along, the engine lives in the [Velt](https://github.com/VeltEngine/Velt) repository. There is also a website at [velt.theodll.me](https://velt.theodll.me) if you want to read more.
